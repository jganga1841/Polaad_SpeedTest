### Properties

  - `items` - (`Array<any>`) - Array of items from which to select. Should be an array of objects with `value` and `text` properties.
  As convenience, you may also pass an array of strings, in which case the same string is used for both the VALUE and the text.
  Items may be nested by adding a `children` property to any item, whose value should be another array of items. Items that have children may omit having an ID.
  If `items` are specified, all items are expected to be available locally and all selection operations operate on this local array only.
  If omitted, items are not available locally, and the `query` option should be provided to fetch data.
  - `ngModel` (`?Array<any>`) - two way data binding. This should be an array with single string or object of `value` and `text` properties in the case of input type 'Single',
  or an array of such objects otherwise. This option is mutually exclusive with value.
  - `placeholder` (`?string=''`) - Placeholder text to display when the element has no focus and selected items.
  - `disabled` (`?boolean=false`) - When `true`, it specifies that the component should be disabled.
  - `item-text` (`?string='text'`) - When items array is different with object properties then map 'text' property with the array.
  - `item-value` (`?string=''`) - Map items array with object to return 'value' and update 'ngModel' object with the value property, if `item-value` is `null` then it return 'value' as whole object of selected item from list.

### Events

  - `change` - it fires after a new option selected; returns object with `value` and `name` properties that describes a new option.
